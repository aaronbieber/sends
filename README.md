# Sends

I know, I know, it's a boring and non-descriptive name. I couldn't be bothered
to be more clever today so this is what it is.

This is a Go program that will scan the YAML "front matter" in all of the
content files of my personal blog looking for a specific key called "sends"
(hence the name) and do various operations on the data under that key.

There is virtually no way this is of use to anyone else so I'll leave it at
that. Also, Claude wrote all the code so I don't even think it's good.
